## Angular as a front-end framework

Angular is a front-end framework for building [single page applications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application) (SPAs).

It is developed by Google and was first released in 2016 as a complete rewrite from [Angular.js](https://angularjs.org/). 

Angular is a framework instead of a library because it is *opinionated*, i.e., it has defined a large part of an application's structure for a developer to build on top of.

Angular embraces [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [dependency injection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection) and [RxJS](https://rxjs.dev/). Therefore, as an Angular developer, you will need to learn these tools to become productive.
